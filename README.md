## What Is Spring?

Spring is an enterprise Java framework. It was designed to simplify Java EE development and make developers more productive. Spring makes use of Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection to promote good software coding practices and speed up development time.

This repository covers Spring Core, Annotations, All Java Spring Configuration, Spring AOP, Spring MVC, Spring Security, Spring REST, Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA.

## What Is Hibernate?

Hibernate is an Object-to-Relational-Mapping (ORM) framework. It simplifies database access for Java applications. By using the framework, you can easily store and retrieve Java objects by setting up some simple configuration mappings.

This repository also covers basic Hibernate CRUD. Also, advanced Hibernate mappings are covered for one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many.

## What is Spring-boot ?

Spring Boot provides a good platform for Java developers to develop a stand-alone and production-grade spring application that you can just run. You can get started with minimum configurations without the need for an entire Spring configuration setup.

## What is Spring data JPA ?

Spring Data JPA provides repository support for the Java Persistence API (JPA). It eases development of applications that need to access JPA data sources.

## What is Spring data REST ?

Spring Data REST is part of the umbrella Spring Data project and makes it easy to build hypermedia-driven REST web services on top of Spring Data repositories.

Spring Data REST builds on top of Spring Data repositories, analyzes your applicationâ€™s domain model and exposes hypermedia-driven HTTP resources for aggregates contained in the model.
